## Overview üìñ

The xmlschema library is an implementation of [XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema) for Rust. It provides a set of functions to validate XML documents against an XML Schema Definition (XSD) file and to convert XML documents to JSON and vice versa.

## Features ‚ú®

This library aims to include the following features:

- Full XSD 1.0 and XSD 1.1 support
- Building of XML schema objects from XSD files
- Validation of XML instances against XSD schemas
- Decoding of XML data into Python data and to JSON
- Encoding of Rust data and JSON to XML

## Installation üì¶

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `xmlschema`.

### Requirements

`xmlschema` requires Rust **1.67.1** or later.

### Documentation
